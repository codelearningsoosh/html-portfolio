            <p>This movie was absolutely bonkers. It was revolutionary.</p>

        <h3>Howl's Moving Castle</h3>
            <p>We love a good Miyazaki movie. A little wild but such a classic.</p>

        <h3>Your Name</h3>
            <p>Another anime movie. Beautifully animated and the story is so sweet.</p>
