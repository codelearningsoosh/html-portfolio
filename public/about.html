<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Josh. I'm currently taking this course for Fullstack Development just to get a feel for programming.</p>

<p>My hobbies include:
   <ul>
    <li>Working out</li>
    <li>Watching anime</li>
    <li>Learning new things</li>
   </ul>  
  </p>

<p>By the end of this course I hope to have a solid portfolio under my belt. I also hope to be able to recreate some popular websites
with functionality.</p>
